# Uberdeno

This repository contains some code snippets I use in every Deno project, with the power of Deno I can import it through the URL. Every import works fine within Deno deploy for almost instant deployments.

- Custom errors
- Helper functions
- Testing functions
- Middleware functions
- Validation functions

And a lot of interfaces / classes to implement and extend! :)
